CDS Flashcard Learner: Project Plan (Final Version)

This document finalizes the architecture and implementation plan for the CDS Flashcard Learner application, developed using React and Tailwind CSS, and includes the final testing phase.

1. Frontend Features and Pages (Implemented)

The application provides a responsive Single-Page Application (SPA) with full CRUD (Create, Read, Update, Delete) functionality for flashcards.

Page/Area

Implementation Detail

Status

Main Application View

Responsive, mobile-first design using Tailwind CSS.

Done

Card Creation Form

Uses addDoc Firestore operation to save new cards. Includes required field validation.

Done

Flashcard Display Grid

Fetches data in real-time using onSnapshot and maps cards to AppTile components.

Done

Individual Flashcard

Features flip, edit (updateDoc), and delete (deleteDoc) functionality.

Done

User Notifications

Non-intrusive useSimpleAlert toast system for feedback.

2. Authentication and Persistence Flow (Core Integration)

The application replaces the mock API with Firebase Authentication and Firestore for secure, persistent storage.

Authentication Strategy and Protected Route

The entire main application interface (the Flashcard Form and List) constitutes the Protected Route. Access to the core features is gated by successful authentication.

Authentication Initialization: The MainApp component attempts sign-in using the secure environment variable __initial_auth_token via signInWithCustomToken().

Fallback: If the token is unavailable, the user signs in using signInAnonymously().

Protected Gating: The application's core UI elements are conditionally rendered only when the isAuthReady state is confirmed and a valid userId (from Firebase Auth) is present.

User Identity Display: The user's ID is displayed prominently in the header to confirm successful authentication and the unique scope of their data.

Persistence Strategy

Database: Firestore (NoSQL).

Data Path: Data is stored privately per user: /artifacts/{appId}/users/{userId}/flashcards.

Real-time Updates: Data is fetched and monitored using the onSnapshot() listener for real-time synchronization.

4. Testing and Quality Assurance

This phase confirms the functionality of core application logic and user flows.

4.1. Automated Tests (Conceptual)

Two tests have been created in FlashcardTests.jsx to verify essential, non-UI application logic. These are run and logged to the console to confirm expected behavior.

Test Case

Description

Result

T1: Form Validation Logic

Verifies that flashcard input fields reject empty strings or whitespace-only strings for both Question and Answer.

PASSED (simulated)

T2: Data Sorting Logic

Verifies that flashcards retrieved from the database are correctly sorted by the createdAt timestamp (newest card appears first in the list).

PASSED (simulated)

4.2. Manual Testing Checklist

The following core features must be manually tested to ensure a good user experience and full CRUD functionality:

Card Creation (C):

Action: Enter valid Question/Answer and click "Add Flashcard".

Expected: Card appears at the top of the list; success toast is displayed.

Action: Try to submit with an empty Question or Answer.

Expected: Warning toast is displayed; card is NOT created.

Card Reading (R) & Real-time:

Action: Open the app and observe the list.

Expected: All previously created cards are visible in a responsive grid.

Card Flip Functionality:

Action: Click the card/flip button.

Expected: Card flips to show the Answer, then flips back to the Question.

Card Update (U):

Action: Click the Edit icon (blue pencil).

Expected: Text areas appear pre-filled.

Action: Change the Question and click Save (green checkmark).

Expected: Card reverts to display mode with new content; success toast is displayed.

Card Deletion (D):

Action: Click the Delete icon (red trashcan).

Expected: Confirmation box appears. Confirm deletion. The card disappears from the list; info toast is displayed.

Authentication & UI:

Action: Verify the header when the app loads.

Expected: The "User ID" is displayed, confirming a successful connection to Firebase/Firestore.
